# Advancement Triggers

Advancements are a way to (but not limited to) gradually guide new players into Minecraft and give them challenges to complete, similar to the more simple system of achievements in Bedrock Edition. Advancements can also be granted (and revoked) with the `/advancement` command. 

Advancement Triggers, as the name suggests, are for triggering advancements upon doing a certain action.
