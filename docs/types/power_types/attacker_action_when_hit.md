# Attacker Action When Hit

[Power Type](../power_types.md)

Executes an entity action on the attacker entity when the entity that has the power is hit by another entity.

Type ID: `origins:attacker_action_when_hit`


### Fields

Field  | Type | Default | Description
-------|------|---------|-------------
`entity_action` | [Entity Action Type](../entity_action_types.md) | | The action to execute on the attacker.
`cooldown` | [Integer](../data_types/integer.md) | | Interval of ticks this power needs to recharge before the power can be triggered again.
`damage_condition` | [Damage Condition Type](../damage_condition_types.md) | _optional_ | If set, the action will only trigger when this condition holds for the damage that was dealt by the attacker.
`hud_render` | [Hud Render](../data_types/hud_render.md) | _optional_ | If specified, determines how the cooldown of this power is visualized on the HUD.


### Examples

```json
{
  "type": "origins:attacker_action_when_hit",
  "entity_action": {
    "type": "origins:add_velocity",
    "y": 2
  },
  "cooldown": 20
}
```

This example will add positive-Y axis velocity to the attacker of the entity that has the power, essentially launching them up into the air.
