### Examples

```json
{
	"type": "origins:action_on_block_use",
	"block_action": {
		"type": "origins:set_block",
		"block": "minecraft:gold_block"
	},
	"block_condition": {
		"type": "origins:block",
		"block": "minecraft:iron_block"
	},
	"directions": [
		"up",
		"down"
	],
	"condition": {
		"type": "origins:sprinting"
	}
}
```

This example will replace any iron blocks with gold blocks if you right click the top or bottom of the block while sprinting.
