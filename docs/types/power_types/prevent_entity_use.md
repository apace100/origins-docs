```json
{
    "type": "origins:prevent_entity_use",
    "bientity_action": {
        "type": "origins:actor_action",
        "action": {
            "type": "origins:execute_command",
            "command": "title @s actionbar {\"text\": \"Cannot interact with pigs!\", \"color\": \"red\"}"
        }
    },
    "bientity_condition": {
        "type": "origins:target_condition",
        "condition": {
            "type": "origins:entity_type",
            "entity_type": "minecraft:pig"
        }
    }
}
```
This example prevents you from interacting with a pig (also prevents powers that enables you to interact with a pig) and executes an `origins:execute_command` entity action to the entity that has attempted to interact with a pig.
