### Examples

```json
{
    "type": "origins:action_when_damage_taken",
    "entity_action": {
        "type": "origins:execute_command",
        "command": "say ow! i'm burning!"
    },
    "damage_condition": {
        "type": "origins:fire"
    },
    "cooldown": 1
}
```

This example will execute an [Execute Command (Entity Action Type)](../entity_action_types/execute_command.md) that will execute a `/say` command that will display a "`[ENTITYNAME] ow! i'm burning!`" in chat if the entity has taken fire-related damage source.
