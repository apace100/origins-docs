Type ID: `origins:action_on_block_break`


### Fields

Field  | Type | Default | Description
-------|------|---------|-------------
`entity_action` | [Entity Action](../entity_action_types.md) | _optional_ | If specified, this action will be executed on the player when a block is broken.
`block_action` | [Block Action Type](../block_action_types.md) | _optional_ | If specified, this action will be executed on the block that is broken.
`block_condition` | [Block Condition Type](../block_condition_types.md) | _optional_ | If set, the specified actions will only trigger when this block condition is met by the broken block.

### Examples

```json
{
    "type": "origins:action_on_block_break",
    "entity_action": {
        "type": "origins:damage",
        "amount": 2.0,
        "source": {
            "name": "onFire",
            "bypasses_armor": true,
            "fire": true
        }
    },
    "block_action": {
        "type": "origins:set_block",
        "block": "minecraft:lava"
    },
    "block_condition": {
        "type": "origins:block",
        "block": "minecraft:magma_block"
    },
    "only_when_harvested": false
}
```

This example will deal 1 heart of `onFire` damage to the player, and place a Lava fluid at where the Magma Block previously was if the player were to mine a Magma Block.
