Provides an inventory with 9 slots that can be opened with the specified [Key](../data_types/key.md); may or may not persist on death.

Type ID: `origins:inventory`


### Fields

Field  | Type | Default | Description
-------|------|---------|-------------
`title` | [String](../data_types/string.md) | `"container.inventory"` | The translation key or literal text to use as the display name for the inventory.
`drop_on_death` | [Boolean](../data_types/boolean.md) | `false` | When this is set to true, the player will drop the items in the inventory on death (vanishing items will vanish!).

`key` | [Key](../data_types/key.md) | _optional_ | Which active key this power should respond to. If none is specified, this power will use the primary active power key (by default G).


### Examples

```json
{
  	"type": "origins:inventory",
  	"drop_on_death": true,
	"drop_on_death_filter": {
		"type": "origins:food",
		"inverted": true
	}
}
```

This example will allow the player to open a 9-slots inventory of which only non-food items will drop on death.
