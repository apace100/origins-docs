### Examples

```json
{
  	"type": "origins:fire_projectile",
	"entity_type": "minecraft:arrow",
  	"cooldown": 2,
	"hud_render": {
		"should_render": false
	},
	"tag": "{pickup:0b}",
	"key": {
		"key": "key.attack",
		"continuous": true
	}
}
```

This example will let the player fire arrows very rapidly by holding the left mouse button. They can't be picked up.

    "type": "origins:fire_projectile",
    "entity_type": "minecraft:snowball",
    "cooldown": 100,
    "hud_render": {
        "should_render": false
    },
    "count": 4,
    "interval": 5,
    "tag": "{Item: {id: 'minecraft:slime_ball', Count: 1b}}",
    "key": {
        "key": "key.use",
        "continuous": false
    }
}
```

This example will let the player fire 4 snow balls disguised as slime balls consecutively, with an interval of 5 ticks upon pressing the right mouse button.
