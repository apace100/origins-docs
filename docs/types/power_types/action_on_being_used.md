### Examples

```json
{
    "type": "origins:action_on_being_used",
    "bientity_action": {
        "type": "origins:mount"
    },
    "bientity_condition": {
        "type": "origins:target_condition",
        "condition": {
            "type": "origins:passenger",
            "inverted": true
        }
    }
}
```

This example will grant the players the ability to mount the target entity that has the power upon "using" (right-clicking) the said entity, unless the entity that has the power already has a passenger.
