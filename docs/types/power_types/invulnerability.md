# Invulnerability

[Power Type](../power_types.md)

Provides damage immunity to specific damage sources.

Type ID: `origins:invulnerability`

!!! note

    This power type does **not** support the [Amount (Damage Condition Type)](../damage_condition_types/amount.md) in its `damage_condition` object. If that specific damage condition type is needed, you can use the [Modify Damage Taken (Power Type)](modify_damage_taken.md) with an [Attribute Modifier](../data_types/attribute_modifier.md) that multiplies the damage taken by 0.)

    (`"multiply_total"` as the `operation` and `-1` as the `value`)


### Fields

Field  | Type | Default | Description
-------|------|---------|-------------
`damage_condition` | [Damage Condition Type](../damage_condition_types.md) | | Specifies which damage the player will be immune to.


### Examples

```json
{
  	"type": "origins:invulnerability",
	"damage_condition": {
		"type": "origins:name",
		"name": "fall"
	}
}
```

This example will make the entity immune to fall damage.
