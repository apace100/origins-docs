# Prevent Block Selection

[Power Type](../power_types.md)

Prevents the selection (i.e. targetting) of blocks for a player. This means they are not able to mine them, and attacks, interactions, etc. will pass through the block to whatever's behind it.

Type ID: `origins:prevent_block_selection`

### Fields

Field  | Type | Default | Description
-------|------|---------|-------------
`block_condition` | [Block Condition](../block_conditions.md) | _optional_ | If specified, only blocks that fulfills this condition is affected.

### Example
```json
{
    "type": "origins:prevent_block_selection",
    "block_condition": {
      "type": "origins:in_tag",
      "tag": "origins:cobwebs"
    },
    "condition": {
      "type": "origins:sneaking",
      "inverted": true
    }
}
```
This power will prevent the selection of cobweb (the tag contains regular cobweb as well as the temporary cobweb from the Arachnid's power), allowing to punch through them, unless they sneak.
