# Action On Callback

[Power Type](../power_types.md)

Execute entity actions depending on the context.

Type ID: `origins:action_on_callback`

!!! note

    For example: when the player chooses an origin that has the power, when the player joins the world, when the player leaves the world, when the player respawns or when the player becomes another origin.

### Fields

Field  | Type | Default | Description
-------|------|---------|-------------
`entity_action_chosen` | [Entity Action](../entity_actions.md) | _optional_ | If specified, this action will be executed on the player when the player chooses their origin on the last layer through the menu - by using the Orb of Origin or missing an origin or joining for the first time - if the power was gained from any of the layers.
`execute_chosen_when_orb` | [Boolean](../types/data_types/boolean.md) | `true` | When this is false, the `entity_action_chosen` will not be executed when the player changes their origin with an orb, but only when the player chooses an origin for the first time or their origin was reset to `origins:empty` via a command.
`entity_action_lost` | [Entity Action](../entity_actions.md) | _optional_ | If specified, this action will be executed on the player when the power is lost.
`entity_action_added` | [Entity Action](../entity_actions.md) | _optional_ | If specified, this action will be executed on the player when the power is added. Joining a world adds each power back.
`entity_action_removed` | [Entity Action](../entity_actions.md) | _optional_ | If specified, this action will be executed on the player when the power is removed and right after the player respawns. Leaving a world removes each power.
`entity_action_respawned` | [Entity Action](../entity_actions.md) | _optional_ | If specified, this action will be executed on the player right after the player respawns, after the `entity_action_removed`.

### Example

```json
{
  	"type": "origins:action_on_callback",
  	"entity_action_chosen": {
    	"type": "origins:execute_command",
    	"command": "team join TheNetherBoys @s",
    	"permission_level": 4
  	},
  	"entity_action_lost": {
    	"type": "origins:execute_command",
    	"command": "team leave @s",
    	"permission_level": 4
  	},
  	"execute_chosen_when_orb": true
}
```
Players will automatically join the team called "TheNetherBoys" when they choose an origin with this power, and will leave the team if they change their origin to another one (which doesn't have this power). Note that in order for this to work, the team must exist beforehand.
