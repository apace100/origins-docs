# Conditioned Restrict Armor

[Power Type](../power_types.md)

Restricts the entity that has the power from equipping items as armor (via right-click, dispensing or by dragging and dropping the item in the equipment slot(s)) in the specified equipment slot(s); may depend on a `condition`.

Type ID: `origins:conditioned_restrict_armor`

!!! note

    You can use the [Restrict Armor](restrict_armor.md) power type if an entity condition is not needed.

### Fields

Field  | Type | Default | Description
-------|------|---------|-------------
`head` | [Item Condition](../item_conditions.md) | _optional_ | If specified, items which fulfills this condition cannot be equipped in the head equipment slot.
`chest` | [Item Condition](../item_conditions.md) | _optional_ | If specified, items which fulfills this condition cannot be equipped in the chest equipment slot.
`legs` | [Item Condition](../item_conditions.md) | _optional_ | If specified, items which fulfills this condition cannot be equipped in the legs equipment slot.
`feet` | [Item Condition](../item_conditions.md) | _optional_ | If specified, items which fulfills this condition cannot be equipped in the feet equipment slot.
`tick_rate` | [Integer](../types/data_types/integer.md) | `80` | The frequency (in ticks) with which to check the condition. Lower values mean the condition changes are detected more quickly, but this comes at a potentially huge performance cost.
