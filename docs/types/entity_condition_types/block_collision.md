# Block Collision

[Entity Condition Type](../entity_condition_types.md)

Checks whether the bounding box of the entity collides with any block.

Type ID: `origins:block_collision`


### Fields

Field  | Type | Default | Description
-------|------|---------|-------------
`offset_x` | [Float](../data_types/float.md) | |  By how much of the bounding box size should the box be offset in the X direction (e.g.: 0 = no offset, 1 = offset of exact width, 2 = offset of twice the width of the bounding box)
`offset_y` | [Float](../data_types/float.md) | |  By how much of the bounding box size should the box be offset in the Y direction (e.g.: 0 = no offset, 1 = offset of exact height, 2 = offset of twice the height of the bounding box)
`offset_z` | [Float](../data_types/float.md) | | By how much of the bounding box size should the box be offset in the Z direction (e.g.: 0 = no offset, 1 = offset of exact depth, 2 = offset of twice the depth of the bounding box)


### Examples

```json
"condition": {
    "type": "origins:block_collision",
    "offset_x": 0.1,
    "offset_y": 0,
    "offset_z": 0.1
}
```

This example will check if the entity is colliding with the positive X or Z faces of a block.
