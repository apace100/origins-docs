# Scoreboard

[Entity Condition Type](../entity_condition_types.md)

Compares the score of the entity from a specified scoreboard objective to a specified value.

Type ID: `origins:scoreboard`

!!! note

    If the player does not have the scoreboard objective, this condition would always return false (even if `"!="` is used). You can then use the `"!="` comparison in combination with the `"=="` comparison to test if the player does not have this objective set (for example, if a player has newly joined a world or had their objectives reset).

!!! caution

    This condition is only effective server-side. That means client-side power types such as [`origins:climbing`](../power_types/climbing.md), [`origins:entity_glow`](../power_types/entity_glow.md), [`origins:shader`](../power_types/shader.md), etc. won't work with this.


### Fields

Field  | Type | Default | Description
-------|------|---------|-------------
`objective` | [String](../data_types/string.md) | | The name of the scoreboard objective to retrieve the value from and compare.
`comparison` | [Comparison](../data_types/comparison.md) | | How to compare the objective's value to the specified value.
`compare_to` | [Integer](../data_types/integer.md) | | The value to compare the objective's value to.


### Examples

```json
"condition": {
    "type": "origins:scoreboard",
    "objective": "obj",
    "comparison": ">",
    "compare_to": 3
}
```

This example will check if the score of the player in the `obj` scoreboard objective is greater than 3.
