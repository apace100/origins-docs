# Origin

[Entity Condition Type](../entity_condition_types.md)

Checks whether the player has a certain origin (optionally in a certain layer). Mostly used for [Origin conditions in layers](../../guides/data/origin_conditions_in_layers.md).

Type ID: `origins:origin`

### Fields:

Field  | Type | Default | Description
-------|------|---------|-------------
`origin` | [Identifier](../data_types/identifier.md) | |  ID of the origin the player needs to have to pass the check.
`layer` | [Identifier](../data_types/identifier.md) | _optional_ |  If set, will check only the layer with the provided ID for the origin.

### Example:
```json
"condition": {
    "type": "origins:origin",
    "origin": "origins:human",
    "layer": "origins:origin"
}
```
This example checks if the player has the `origins:human` origin that is provided by the `origins:origin` origin layer.
