# Relative Health

[Entity Condition Type](../entity_condition_types.md)

Checks the current health (relative value) of the player. Relative means it will check the percentage of the health, i.e. `currentHealth / maxHealth`.

Type ID: `origins:relative_health`

### Fields:

Field  | Type | Default | Description
-------|------|---------|-------------
`comparison` | [Comparison](../data_types/comparison.md) | | How the relative health of the player should be compared to the specified value.
`compare_to` | [Float](../data_types/float.md) | | Which value the relative health should be compared to.

### Example:
```json
"condition": {
    "type": "origins:relative_health",
    "comparison": "<=",
    "compare_to": 0.5
}
```
This example checks if the player has half or less of their max health.
