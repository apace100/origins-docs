# Command

[Entity Condition Type](../entity_condition_types.md)

Stores the result of the specified command, and compares the stored result to a specified value.

Type ID: `origins:command`

!!! caution

    This condition is only effective server-side. That means client-side power types such as [`origins:climbing`](../power_types/climbing.md), [`origins:entity_glow`](../power_types/entity_glow.md), [`origins:shader`](../power_types/shader.md), etc. won't work with this.


### Fields

Field  | Type | Default | Description
-------|------|---------|-------------
`command` | [String](../data_types/string.md) | |  The command to execute.
`comparison` | [Comparison](../data_types/comparison.md) | | How to compare the stored result of the specified command to the specified value.
`compare_to` | [Integer](../data_types/integer.md) | | The value to compare the stored result of the specified command to.


### Examples

```json
"condition": {
    "type": "origins:command",
    "command": "execute if score @s objective1 = @s objective2",
    "comparison": "==",
    "compare_to": 1
}
```
This example will check if the entity has the same score in the `objective1` and `objective2` scoreboard objectives.

```json
"condition": {
    "type": "origins:command",
    "command": "execute if entity @e[type = #minecraft:skeletons, distance = ..64]",
    "comparison": ">=",
    "compare_to": 4
}
```

This example will check if there are 4 or more entities that are included in the `#minecraft:skeletons` (`data/minecraft/tags/entity_types/skeletons.json`) entity type tag within a 64 blocks spherical radius relative to the entity.
