# On Block

[Entity Condition Type](../entity_condition_types.md)

Checks whether the player is standing on the ground, and optionally has a block that matches a specified block condition under them.

Type ID: `origins:on_block`

### Fields:

Field  | Type | Default | Description
-------|------|---------|-------------
`block_condition` | [Block Condition](../block_conditions.md) | _optional_ |  If set, a block that satisfies this block condition needs to be right below the player's feet.

### Example:

```json
"condition": {
    "type": "origins:on_block",
    "block_condition": {
        "type": "origins:block",
        "block": "minecraft:grass_block"
    }
}
```

This condition applied to a power will make sure it's only active while the player is on a Grass Block.
