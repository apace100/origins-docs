# Brightness

[Entity Condition Type](../entity_condition_types.md)

Checks the brightness level at the entity's eyes, which ranges from 0 to 1.

Type ID: `origins:brightness`

!!! note

    To calculate brightness at the player's eyes, the game first gathers the light level of the block the eyes are inside of. This light level is the highest between the block and sky light levels of the block. Then it calculates brightness with the following formula: `brightness = ambientLight + (1 - ambientLight) * lightLevel / (60 - 3 * lightLevel)`, with `ambientLight` as the dimension's ambient light, which is 0 in the overworld and the End, and 0.1 in the Nether. Thus the formula simplifies to `brightness = lightLevel / (60 - 3 * lightLevel)` for the overworld and the End. The calculated values, however, are slightly off due to [the imprecision of floating point calculations](https://0.30000000000000004.com/).

    Here's a table of light levels to brightness levels:

    Light level | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15
    ------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----
    Overworld brightness | 0.0 | 0.017543862 | 0.03703704 | 0.05882353 | 0.08333334 | 0.11111111 | 0.14285715 | 0.17948718 | 0.22222225 | 0.2727273 | 0.33333334 | 0.40740743 | 0.50000006 | 0.6190476 | 0.77777773 | 1.0
    Nether brightness | 0.1 | 0.11578947 | 0.13333334 | 0.15294118 | 0.17500001 | 0.2 | 0.22857144 | 0.26153848 | 0.3 | 0.34545457 | 0.4 | 0.4666667 | 0.5500001 | 0.6571428 | 0.79999995 | 1.0


### Fields

Field  | Type | Default | Description
-------|------|---------|-------------
`comparison` | [Comparison](../data_types/comparison.md) | | How to compare the brightness level against the specified value.
`compare_to` | [Float](../data_types/float.md) | | The value to compare the brightness level to.


### Examples

```json
"condition": {
    "type": "origins:brightness",
    "comparison": "<=",
    "compare_to": 0.5
}
```

This example will check if the brightness level at the player's eyes is 0.5 or lower, which corresponds to a light level of 11 or below in any of the three default dimesnions.
