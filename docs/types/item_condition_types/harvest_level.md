# Harvest Level

[Item Condition Type](../item_condition_types.md)

Checks whether the material of the item has a certain harvest level value. Refer to [this page on the Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tiers) for the harvest level of the materials (there it's called "mining level"). Items without a material are considered to have a harvest level of 0.

Type ID: `origins:harvest_level`


### Fields

Field  | Type | Default | Description
-------|------|---------|-------------
`comparison` | [Comparison](../data_types/comparison.md) | |  How to compare the item's harvest level to the specified value.
`compare_to` | [Integer](../data_types/integer.md) | | Which value to compare the item's harvest level to.


### Examples

```json
"item_condition": {
    "type": "origins:harvest_level",
    "comparison": ">",
    "compare_to": 1
}
```

This example checks if the item has a harvest level higher than 1, which is the value for stone tools.
