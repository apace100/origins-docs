# Condition Types

Condition Types, along-side [Action Types](action_types.md) are Origins' main way of defining more complex functionality of powers in the new data-driven system. They were introduced in version 0.4.0, which is the update that made powers data-driven.

They are grouped by the type of object they act on, such as living entities, blocks or items.
