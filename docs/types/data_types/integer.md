# Integer

[Data Type](../data_types.md)

A whole number (integer number), like 3 or -1. Numbers such as 0.3 or 5.5 are not allowed, those would be [Floats](float.md).

### Example

```json
{	
	"type":"origins:set_on_fire",
	"duration": 3
}
```

An [`origins:set_on_fire` entity action](../entity_actions/set_on_fire.md) that has a `duration` value of 3, which is a whole number.
