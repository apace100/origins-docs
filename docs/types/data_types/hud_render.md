# Hud Render

[Data Type](../data_types.md)

An [Object](object.md) used to define how a resource or cooldown bar should be rendered.

### Fields:

Field  | Type | Default | Description
-------|------|---------|-------------
`should_render` | [Boolean](boolean.md) | `true` | Whether the bar should be visible or not.
`sprite_location` | [Identifier](identifier.md) | `"origins:textures/gui/resource_bar.png"` | The path to the file in the assets which contains what the bar looks like. See the [List of resource bar files](../../misc/extra/sprites.md) for a list of files included by default in the mod.
`bar_index` | [Integer](integer.md) | `0` | The indexed position of the bar on the sprite to use. Please note that indexes start at 0.
`condition` | [Entity Condition](../entity_conditions.md) | _optional_ | If set (and `should_render` is true), the bar will only display when the entity with the power fulfills this condition.
`inverted` | [Boolean](boolean.md) | `false` | If set to true, inverts the way the hud render process (it'll look like its value is being decreased).

### Examples:

```json
"hud_render": {
	"bar_index": 4,
	"condition": {
		"type": "origins:power_active",
		"power": "origins:phantomize"
	}
}
```

This definition shows the resource/cooldown as the Elytrian bar (white and with a wings icon), but only while the player is phantomized.
