# Comparison

[Data Type](../data_types.md)

A [String](string.md) which specifies how two numbers should be compared. Usually the first number is provided by whatever condition you are in, and the second is specified in an accompanying `compare_to` field.

### Values

Value  | Description
-------|------
`<` | Checks if the first number is **less than** the second number.
`<=` | Checks if the first number is **less than or equal to** the second number.
`>` | Checks if the first number is **greater than** the second number.
`>=` | Checks if the first number is **greater than or equal to** the second number.
`==` | Checks if the first number is **equal to** the second number.
`!=` | Checks if the first number is **not equal to** the second number.

	"comparison": "=="
}
