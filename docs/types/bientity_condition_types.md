# Bi-entity Condition Types

Bi-entity Condition Types operate on a `Pair<Entity, Entity>`, or in simpler terms: an actor and a target. The actor and target is determined depending on the used power type, and can be swapped. These are available to power/condition types that provides a `bientity_condition` object field.
