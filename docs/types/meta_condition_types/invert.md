[Meta Condition Type](../meta_condition_types.md)

Swaps the context of the target entity and the actor entity.

Type ID: `origins:invert`

!!! note

	**Only available as a [Bi-entity Condition Type](../bientity_condition_types.md).**


### Fields

Field  | Type | Default | Description
-------|------|---------|-------------
`condition` | [Bi-entity Condition Type](../bientity_condition_types.md) | | The bi-entity condition type to check which will have its 'target' and 'actor' contexts swapped.


### Examples

```json
"bientity_condition": {
    "type": "origins:invert",
    "condition": {
        "type": "origins:can_see"
    }
}
```

This example will check if the target entity can see the actor entity, as the roles are now swapped.
