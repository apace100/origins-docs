### Examples

```json
"bientity_action": {
    "type": "origins:damage",
    "amount": 10,
    "damage_type": "minecraft:cramming"
}
```

This example will deal 5 hearts of `cramming` damage to the target as if the actor has hit them, and that, if killed, will display a *"`<targetName>` was squashed by `<actorName>`",* where `<targetName>` is the name of the target and `<actorName>` is the name of the actor.
