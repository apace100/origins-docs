# Biome Condition Types

Biome Condition Types operate on a `RegistryEntry<Biome>`, allowing to check if the said entry is in a certain `TagKey<?>`, which in this case, `?` will be `Biome`, and the properties of the biome within the entry. These are only available to the `condition` field of the [Biome (Entity Condition Type)](entity_condition_types/biome.md).
