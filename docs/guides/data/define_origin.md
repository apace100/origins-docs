# Defining an Origin in JSON

Origins are defined in JSON files. Let's use these to create a fictional new origin, a _Supermorph_, for our [data pack](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Data_Pack) which we call _OriginSuperPack_. We'd like this Origin to be a bit overpowered: Metamorphs are immune to fire, have elytra-flight and can teleport with ender pearls. Their only drawback is that they need a bed at a high altitude, just like Avians. This would be a JSON file which would accomplish that:

```json
{
	"powers": [
		"origins:fire_immunity",
		"origins:elytra",
		"origins:throw_ender_pearl",
		"origins:fresh_air"
	],
	"icon": "minecraft:slime_ball",
	"order": 4,
	"impact": 1
}
```

This is the JSON file defining our new _Supermorph_ origin. We put it in `data/originsuperpack/origins/supermorph.json`. In general, the file location should be as follows: `data/<namespace>/origins/<path>.json`. You can also use the namespace `origins` and the name of an existing origin, such as `avian`, in order to override the origin defined by the default mod: `data/origins/origins/avian.json`.

When you put the file in the correct file structure of a data pack and put it into a world (either when you create the world, or after the world is loaded drag it into the world's `datapacks` folder), the new origin still does not appear (at least not in v0.3.0 and above)! Why? **Layers.**

The new origin still needs to be added to the origin layer. Layers are Origins' way of allowing players to have multiple origins. By default, there is only one layer, `origins:origin`. If you wanted, you could create your own layer and allow players to select a second origin! Here's how to add our origin to the default origin layer though: we need to create a layer file with the same ID of the layer we want to add to. This means our file should be located in `data/origins/origin_layers/origin.json`. The file content would then look like this:

```json
{
	"replace": false,
	"origins": [
		"originsuperpack:supermorph"
	]
}
```

`replace` just tells Origins that we want to add to the already existing layer, instead of replacing it entirely. The `origins` field meanwhile specifies the IDs of the origins we want to append to the layer. See below for a complete description of the layer format (which is relevant if you want to create your own layer).

Now, our newly created _Supermorph_ origin should show up, along with a nice slimeball icon, in the list.

However, the origin still doesn't display a correct name or description. One way to fix that is by adding a [resource pack](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Resource_Pack) as well, with a translation for the language you're playing in (probably `en_us.json`):
```json
{
	"origin.originsuperpack.supermorph.name": "Supermorph",
	"origin.originsuperpack.supermorph.description": "The Supermorphs are crazy origins which I created for a tutorial!"
}
```

Instead of adding these to a resource pack though, which would be required on the client-side, Origins also allows setting a name and description in the datapack. To do that, just add a `name` and a `description` field to the JSON file defining your origin, like this:

```json
{
	"powers": [
		"origins:fire_immunity",
		"origins:elytra",
		"origins:throw_ender_pearl",
		"origins:fresh_air"
	],
	"icon": "minecraft:slime_ball",
	"order": 4,
	"impact": 1,
	"name": "Supermorph",
	"description": "The Supermorphs are crazy origins which I created for a tutorial!"
}
```

That concludes this tutorial on how to define custom origins using existing powers. If everything works, the next step would be to learn how to [add a custom power](define_power.md)
